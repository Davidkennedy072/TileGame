Idea is to have bfrontier units as main character
Terraria items as obtainable items throughout the game with variable stats
player has lots of different stats, health, defense, attack, elemental attack, etc
terraria debuffs as buffs and debuffs in the game, along with bfrontier buffs/debuffs
player has sphereical hitbox displayed, hitbox radius is a stat
attack is tick dependent (where tick is time (s) dependent). ie:
player has skills (copy bf skils but edited), that activate every so many seconds. eg:
main attack activates every 10 sec, and enemies in range are hit, special attack initates every 10 sec, etc.
each bfrontier character has special ability (copy from bfontier special skills) that are passive and boost stats along with items.
some items give special skills, some bfrontier character need specific item to activate special skills.
Something like: normal attack - 10 sec, brave burst (1st special) - 15 sec, super burst (2nd special) - 2 min, ultimate burst (ultimate) - 5 mins.
some characters and items will have heals or percent heals per sec.

when character attacks, complex calculation determines how much of each stat the character gains and how much the maximum increases
Stats: HP, DEF, Speed, (fire, earth, water air, light, dark) attack, vampirism, the force good vs bad, attack speed, critical rate, critical damage, pure damage, life per hit, magic find, etc

Use realm of the mad god loot bags for when enemies die (color relating to highest rank contents)
Use Terraria hearts or BF hearts?
